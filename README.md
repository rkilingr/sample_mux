# sample_mux
My First go database app which consists of CRUD operations on a Customers DataBase.

Keep mysql installed in your system.

Export these environment variables -

```
export DB_USER=<Your mysql Username>
export DB_PASSWORD=<Your mysql Password>
export DB_HOST=<Your mysql Host('localhost' for local)>  
```

For running TestCases  
``
go test -run .  
``

For running the Backend app  
``  
go run .  
``
